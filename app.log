the universal claim that every bit of matter attracts every other bit of matter?', 'Why does Newton treat inertia (vis inertiae) as an essential property but regard gravity as not necessarily essential?', "What is the role and proper use of induction in Newton's Rule IV, and how could inductive claims be undermined by hypotheses?", "What problems does Newton identify with the hypothesis of vortices (Descartes' planetary theory)?", 'Which features of the solar system does Newton say cannot be explained solely by the laws of gravity and require additional account?', "How does Newton
